"""
SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH — C817 AI Application for Google Sheet (non-WSQ).

A beginner, one-day (7.5 hours), hands-on short course on using generative AI —
Google's Gemini — inside Google Sheets to generate and explain formulas, clean
and transform data, analyse datasets, and build tables, charts and visualisations,
while validating AI output and applying it safely to real work data. Every
artifact (PPT, LP, LG, LG.md) and every lab is generated from this module +
data_domainN.py so they stay 100% aligned.

NON-WSQ RULES — the engine enforces these, do not reintroduce them here:
  * NO assessment of any kind (no WA/SAQ, no PP, no case study, no marking).
  * NO SSG / SkillsFuture / WSQ funding or subsidy content.
  * NO TRAQOM survey, NO digital attendance, NO 75% attendance rule.
  * NO TGS course reference — this course carries the plain code C817.
